# robolibs libraries

This repository hosts a collection of libraries and tools that might ease the development and usage of robotic controllers, written in C++.

## Features
Four libraries are included: *utilities*, *sec*, *robots* and *neural*.

* **utilities** is a library of basic functions that are needed for other libraries, including some convenience wrappers around C++ Standard Library functionalities and operations on vectors. It also provides classes for discrete-time signals representations, as well as discrete differentiation and integration.

* **sec** is the core library that provides the framework for the creation of the robotic controllers. With this framework, a controller can be created as a set of execution units that can be run independently at different specified frequencies, and that exchange data between them. Such units are created by specifing only their business logic, as the provided synchronization mechanism will take care of the multi-threading and data exchange. GUIs for live plotting, experimental results browsing and control of the developed systems are also included alongside the main library.

* **robots** (optional) includes classes and functions to access commonly used robots, as well as the integration of these into the sec framework. Currently, there is support for the [iCub](http://www.icub.org/) robot and for [ROS](http://www.ros.org/)/[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/).

* **neural** (optional) includes classes and functions to access commonly used neural simulators, as well as the integration of these into the sec framework. Currently, there is support for [NEST](http://www.nest-simulator.org/) and [SpiNNaker](https://spinnakermanchester.github.io/). A GUI for the live plotting of raster plots is also included.

## Dependencies
As many components of the libraries are optional, the only requirement to compile the core libraries (*utilities* and *sec*) is a C++11 compliant compiler and CMake. The GUIs depend instead on Qt5.

*robots* has optional dependencies in the iCub libraries and ROS + the patched gazebo_ros packages that can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/hbpneurorobotics/gazeborospackages).

*neural* has optional dependencies in NEST and SpiNNaker libraries.


## Installing and running
In order to compile the libraries and executables one has to run

```sh
$ cd robolibs
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install
```

Some CMake flags for the customization of the build are (all `TRUE` by default):

* `BUILD_GUI`: to build the GUIs;
* `WITH_ROBOTS`: to build the *robots* library, further customization can be achieved by setting `WITH_ICUB` and `WITH_GAZEBO`;
* `WITH_NEURAL`: to build the *neural* library, further customization can be achieved by setting `WITH_NEST` and `WITH_SPINNAKER`;
* `ENABLE_TEST`: to build and enable automated testing suites.

## Documentation
A `make doc` target is generated by CMake, that creates documentation that can be built by Doxygen.
